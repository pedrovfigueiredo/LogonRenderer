# Logon Renderer
Repository for Allocating the Logon Renderer Project.

![alt text](https://logonrenderer.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/1-3.png)

It is a project started on the Phisically Based Rendering course, offered by Prof. Dr. Christian Pagot, at Federal University of Paraiba.

It is possible to follow my step-by-step progression through the blog: https://logonrenderer.wordpress.com. In there you will find explanation to all the updates and know a little more about the sources I use and even the mistakes I made when implementing a new feature. There are resulting images for every update.

It is only available in Portuguese for the moment being but further english translations are expected.
