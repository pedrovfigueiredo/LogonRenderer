# RayTracer
Repository for Allocating the Ray Tracer Renderer.

It is used on the Phisically Based Rendering course, offered by Prof. Dr. Christian Pagot, at Federal University of Paraiba.

It is possible to follow my step-by-step progression through my personal blog: https://phisicallybasedrendering2016-2.blogspot.com.br. In there you will find explanation to all the updates and know a little more about the steps I am taking.

It is only available in Portuguese for the moment being but further translations can be expected.
